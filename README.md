## 📜 Description  

Urban parking is inefficient, costly, and opaque. **ParkBNB** solves this by creating a **decentralized, trustless marketplace** for individuals to rent out their private parking spots to drivers.  

By leveraging **EVM-compatible smart contracts**, ParkBNB eliminates intermediaries, automates escrow payments, and ensures all transactions are recorded transparently on-chain.  

The platform uses a **pay-per-use model**:  
- Renters deposit funds upfront into a **smart contract escrow**.  
- QR codes handle **check-in and check-out**.  
- Upon leaving, the contract calculates the exact cost, pays the host, and refunds the remaining balance instantly.

## ✨ Core Features  

- **Peer-to-Peer Listings** – Anyone with a parking spot can become a host.  
- **Secure Escrow** – Deposits are locked in the smart contract, not with the host.  
- **QR Code Check-In/Out** – Start and stop parking seamlessly.  
- **Automated On-Chain Settlement** – Payments & refunds are instant and tamper-proof.  
- **Transparent & Trustless** – Every booking and payment is visible on-chain.
